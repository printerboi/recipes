- **25g** Sugar
- **15g** Baking yeast
- **85g** Powdered sugar
- **1** Spoon vanilla extract
- **1** Small spoon of salt
- **120g** Butter (liquid)
- **100ml** Heavy Cream

Cinnamon filling:
- **120g** Butter (soft)
- **80g** Brown sugar
- **80g** White sugar
- **4** Small spoons of cinnamon

Frosting:
- **150g** Cream Cheese
- **1** Small spoon of vanilla extract
- **4** Spoons of powdered sugar
- **100ml** Heavy Cream

## Cooking

### Preparing the dough

- Add the warm milk, the yeast, and the sugar to a container, stir until everything dissolves, and let the mixture rest for 10 minutes
- In a separate container, add the flour, salt, powdered sugar, melted butter, and the vanilla extract
- Add the milk-yeast mixture slowly and knead until a soft and clean dough forms
- Cover the dough with a clean towel and let it rest for at least 2h

### Preparing the filling

- In another separate container, combine soft butter, brown sugar and white sugar
- Mix until a uniform mass forms
- Add the cinnamon and stir

### Forming the dough

- After the dough has risen, roll out the dough into a ~5mm thick rectangle
- Spread the rolled-out dough with the cinnamon mixture
- Starting from one of the long sides, roll up the dough. Pay attention to rolling it tightly.
- After forming a nice roll, start cutting it into 25mm thick pieces
- Place the pieces with one of the open sides facing down into a casserole
- After all pieces have been placed, cover the casserole with a clean towel and let it rest for at least 10min
- After that, pour some heavy cream on the floor of the casserole and the buns. This will ensure that they remain soft after baking.

### Baking

- Bake the buns at 200°C (Ober-/Unterhitze) in the oven for 15 to 20 min.

### Add the topping

- After the buns had time to cool down, mix together the cream cheese, the vanilla extract, the powdered sugar, and the heavy cream
- Stir until a uniform mixture forms
- Spread the cream cheese topping on top of the baked buns
- Place the cinnamon buns in the fridge for at least 1h so the frosting can become solid

Bon appétit
