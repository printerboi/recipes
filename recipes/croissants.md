## Cooking

### Preparing the dough

- Prepare the butter for further usage by removing it from the fridge
- Add milk, flour, sugar, yeast, and salt into a bowl and combine until a smooth dough forms
- Form a ball with the dough
- Add flour to your working surface and roll out the dough to the size of a A4 paper
- Cover the dough with plastic wrap
- Put the covered dough 30-45 minutes into the fridge

### Preparing the butter plate

- Add flour onto the working surface
- Place the butter onto the surface and cover with a little bit of flour
- Roll out the butter to half the size of the dough inside the fridge
- Cover the butter in plastic wrap and put it into the fridge for 30 minutes

### Starting the folding

- Remove the dough and the butter plate from the fridge
- Put the butter plate on one half of the dough
- Fold the other half of the dough over the butter and press the sides together
- Roll out the dough-butter combination to 3 times its size along one axis
- Fold one-third of the dough from the left onto the center of the dough, and fold the right third on top
- Turn the dough by 90° and repeat the rolling and folding
- Cover the folded dough again and cool for 20 minutes

Repeat the folding and cooling at least one more time.
After the final folding, cool the dough for 3h

### Preparing the croissants

- Heat the oven to 210°C (Umluft)
- Roll out the dough as far as possible (maybe split the dough into two parts if necessary)
- Cut the dough into isosceles long triangles
- Roll each triangle towards its tip
- Place the croissants on a baking tray

- Add the egg yolks, milk and the salt into a bowl
- Stir until a smooth liquid forms
- Brush the croissants with the egg-milk mixture, this will give them a nice tan
- Bake the croissants for 15min, keep an eye on the tan

Bon appétit
