- Chop the dark chocolate into fine pieces.
- Add half of the chopped chocolate and the melted butter into a pot. Put the pot into the boiling water.
- Melt butter and chocolate by stirring the mixture constantly.
- After the ingredients have melted, add the sunflower oil and put the mixture aside.
- In a separate bowl, add the eggs, the brown sugar, and the white sugar and whip until frothy.
- In another bowl, mix flour, baking powder, and baking cocoa.
- Combine the chocolate butter mixture, the egg-sugar mix, and the dry ingredients by stirring vigorously.
- Add the remaining chocolate to the dough and mix.


### Finishing the brownies

- Pour the dough into the prepared baking tray.
- Smooth out the tray.
- Bake the brownies for approximately 20-30 minutes.

### Topping

If you like your brownies more chocolatey, you can add chunks of chocolate onto the baking tray just right before baking. Additionally
you can add powdered sugar for a sweet finish after the brownies have been baked. Keep in mind that the consistency of the brownies is strongly dependent on the baking time. If you like it more fudgy, keep the baking time close to 20 minutes.
